# ULTRON Windows Wake Companion

This is a small, free-first Windows tray companion for the exact wake word **“Ultron”**. It uses the installed Windows System.Speech recognition engine and does not send microphone audio to the ULTRON server. No speech model is downloaded automatically.

## Build

Requires the .NET 8 SDK and Windows Desktop targeting support.

```powershell
dotnet restore .\windows-companion\Ultron.Companion.csproj
dotnet publish .\windows-companion\Ultron.Companion.csproj -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained true -p:PublishSingleFile=true -p:IncludeNativeLibrariesForSelfExtract=true -o .\artifacts\ultron-windows-companion
```

The GitHub Actions workflow builds this project on Windows and uploads a downloadable ULTRON.Companion.exe artifact.

## Use

1. Start ULTRON.Companion.exe.
2. Click **Start wake word** and accept the microphone-consent prompt.
3. Keep the companion running in the Windows tray. Saying “Ultron” opens the hosted ULTRON assistant in the default browser.
4. Optionally enable **Start with Windows and listen**. The app asks for microphone consent first, then registers a visible, per-user Windows startup entry. On future sign-ins, the app starts into the tray and begins listening using that previously granted opt-in.
5. Use the tray menu to pause listening or exit the companion. Uncheck **Start with Windows and listen** to remove automatic startup.

Windows must have an installed compatible English speech-recognition engine and microphone permission. If no compatible recognizer is installed, the listener stays off and reports the problem. Audio is not sent to ULTRON by this app.

## Outbound request protection

The optional approved-action bridge API client resolves and validates every address before connecting and pins its TCP socket to the selected validated destination. DNS answers containing a disallowed IPv4/IPv6 address are rejected as a set. TLS verification and SNI remain tied to the original HTTPS hostname. Redirects and system proxy use are disabled to avoid bypassing the destination policy. An environment that requires an outbound proxy may fail closed.

The Windows Actions workflow compiles the app, executes the network-address policy self-test plus a bounded local loopback HTTP request through the actual pinned handler, then publishes a standalone x64 artifact. The self-test never contacts a public service. A passing CI build/test is not proof of a real paired Windows device; action polling must remain opted out until the owner has installed the artifact, confirmed the server-side migration and API revision are available, and explicitly approved a harmless test action.

## Boundaries

- This is a wake-word launcher, not a completed Windows PC-control agent or a full live voice conversation client.
- It cannot unlock Windows, bypass PIN/biometrics, or run while the PC is powered off. Sleep/resume and locked-session behavior depend on Windows and device policy.
- Wake-word recognition is available only while the companion is running, the Windows session/audio device is available, and the installed speech recognizer works.
- Automatic startup is off by default and only enabled by an explicit checkbox after microphone consent. It uses the current user's normal Windows Run registry entry and stays visible in the system tray; it does not create a hidden task or service.
- It does not hide microphone activity, execute arbitrary commands, or perform consequential actions.
